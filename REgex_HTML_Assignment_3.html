            Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer 
            grass that tickles your feet or the bed Bordeaux smacking on 
            your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries 
            special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can 
            tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance 
            are from where they travelled and what happened to them 
            along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex 
            and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new 
            method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.

            <td>BY CYNTHIA HAVEN L.A. Cicero Lindy Hop instruction Stanford 
            is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement --- but life in the Stanford 
            dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos. The June 26-28 Stanford's 
            Dance Weekend in Roble Gym offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too:
            the hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood and blues fashion.
